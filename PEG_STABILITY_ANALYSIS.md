## 🧠 **LLM Interpretation for Peg Analysis**

### 📝 **Why Peg Analysis is More Relevant**

**Peg Stability vs Volatility:**
- **Peg Deviations**: Direct measure of stablecoin core function
- **Volatility**: General price movement (less specific to stablecoins)
- **Policy Impact**: Central bank policy directly affects USD peg maintenance
- **Arbitrage Mechanisms**: Peg deviations trigger market corrections

### 🎯 **Sentiment-Peg Relationship Theory**

**Hawkish Policy (Tightening):**
- **Higher Interest Rates**: Increases opportunity cost of holding stablecoins
- **Reduced Liquidity**: Tighter monetary conditions
- **Risk Appetite**: Lower risk tolerance, flight to quality
- **Expected Impact**: Slight peg pressure (trading below $1.00)

**Dovish Policy (Easing):**
- **Lower Interest Rates**: Reduces opportunity cost of holding stablecoins
- **Increased Liquidity**: More accommodative conditions
- **Risk Appetite**: Higher risk tolerance
- **Expected Impact**: Slight peg premium (trading above $1.00)

**Neutral Policy:**
- **Status Quo**: Maintains current monetary stance
- **Expected Impact**: Stable peg maintenance

### 📊 **Quantitative Methodology**

**1. Peg Deviation Calculation:**
```
Peg Deviation = Price - $1.00
Absolute Deviation = |Price - $1.00|
Peg Stability = 1 - Average Absolute Deviation
```

**2. Sentiment Scoring:**
```
Hawkish = +1 (tightening signals)
Neutral = 0 (balanced stance)
Dovish = -1 (accommodative signals)
```

**3. Statistical Analysis:**
- **Correlation Analysis**: Sentiment vs peg deviations
- **t-tests**: Compare peg stability across sentiment categories
- **Event Studies**: Peg response around policy announcements
- **Stress Analysis**: Peg stress events around policy dates

### 📈 **A. Peg Stability Metrics**

**Core Metrics:**
1. **Peg Deviation**: Raw deviation from $1.00
2. **Absolute Deviation**: Magnitude of deviation (stability measure)
3. **Peg Stability Score**: 1 - average absolute deviation
4. **Stress Events**: Days with >1% deviation from peg

**Advanced Metrics:**
1. **Peg Recovery Time**: Time to return to $1.00 after deviation
2. **Peg Persistence**: Duration of sustained deviations

### 🎯 **B. Policy Impact Analysis**

**Event Study Framework:**
- **Pre-Event Window**: 5 days before policy announcement
- **Event Day**: Policy announcement date
- **Post-Event Window**: 5 days after policy announcement
- **Control Period**: 250 days for normal peg behavior

**Metrics:**
- **Abnormal Peg Deviation**: Actual vs expected peg deviation
- **Cumulative Abnormal Deviation**: Sum of deviations over event window
- **Peg Stress Probability**: Likelihood of >1% deviation around events

### 📊 **C. Cross-Stablecoin Analysis**

**Stablecoin Categories:**
1. **Centralized (USDT, USDC)**: Traditional fiat-backed
2. **Decentralized (DAI, LUSD)**: Algorithmic/collateralized
